# EntryLevel-Project-1.
In this project, I extensively used Excel and Tableau to analyze data. (Udemy course revenue data and Rec Corp Ltd sales data).
On this project I worked as a Data Analyst for Udemy, I was presented with various data on course revenue at Udemy to understand and identify opportunities to increase revenue, monitor the performance of the different courses, and identify the most popular course.
This project I worked on as assigned by Udemy is a comprehensive data set mainly containing information about various subjects offered in a particular class in a school. Together with details about the different subjects were various other parameters linked directly or indirectly to the subjects.
These parameters include the price of each course in a particular subject offered, the URL link to each course, the number of reviews and subscribers for each course, the level and ratings of individual courses, the duration of each course, date of each course, a subject which each course falls under and whether each course is paid orfree for each student.
From the provided data, I observed a trend that proved that Web development was the most popular of all the subjects and consequentially generated the most revenue.
